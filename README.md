# Group Management

This is a group Management system where students and teachers can be added to classes. The objects can be added/edited/removed over the view controller. There are three roles which can be seen in the JSON files. The project is a website, altough I isn't deployed yet.

It is written in Java EE and the frontend with HTML, CSS and JavaScript.
